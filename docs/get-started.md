### Customize peer nodes

echoshare uses [peer-server](https://github.com/peers/peerjs-server) as the WebRTC API and `https://0.peerjs.com` as the peer node by default.

If you want to use a customized peer node, you can enter the corresponding server address in the Settings page.

A sample configuration is shown below:

1. Node located under port 443

```
https://your.server.com/custom-path
```

2. Nodes are located under other ports

```
https://your.server.com:3456/custom-path
```

3. Node configured with [key attribute](https://peerjs.com/docs/#peer-options-key)

```
https://your.server.com:3456/custom-path?key=your-key
```

## Customizing the STUN/TURN server

In special cases, you also need to configure the STUN/TURN server, as shown in the following example:

### Configuration interface with STUN server

```
https://your-stun-api.com
```

Then click the button below, echoshare will get the STUN server address through this interface and save it in json format.

### manually enter the configuration in json format

Enter and click save, just enter the configuration in array format.

## Customize webhook

echoshare provides the ability to customize webhook, you can enter the corresponding webhook address in `/~webhook` route. With webhooks, you can automate workflows, such as sending notifications when a share ends, pulling share records automatically, and so on.

### Customize data

![custom data](https://i.postimg.cc/P5JJXTzr/image.png)

echoshare carries the following content that you fill in **custom data** in the webhook for your convenience. All custom data is carried under the `custom` attribute in all echoshare requests.

### pull the UID webhook

The webhook itself is a GET request, and you can get the shared UID in the destination address, which is mainly used for receiving media.

Note that the destination must be a URL that provides a GET interface and the return data must contain a `uid` entry, otherwise echoshare will not resolve the UID.

echoshare The parameters carried in this request:

```json
{
  "hook": "on-get",
  "action": "receive",
  "timestamp": "{current-timestamp}"
}
```

### push UID webhook

The webhook itself is a POST request. When you share a stream and generate a UID credit, echoshare sends a POST request to the destination address, which looks like this:

```json
{
  "uid": "{your-uid}",
  "hook": "on-post",
  "action": "share",
  "timestamp": "{current-timestamp}",
  "custom": {
    "your-custom-data": "{your-custom-data}"
  }
}
```

### Successful webhooks for media streaming

The webhook itself is a POST request. When you successfully share or receive a stream, echoshare sends a POST request to the destination address as follows:

```json
{
  "uid": "{your-uid}",
  "result": "success",
  "hook": "on-success",
  "action": "{share | receive}",
  "timestamp": "{current-timestamp}",
  "custom": {
    "your-custom-data": "{your-custom-data}"
  }
}
```

### Failed webhook for sending and receiving media streams

The webhook itself is a POST request. When you fail to share or receive a media stream, echoshare sends a POST request to the destination address as follows:

```json
{
  "uid": "{your-uid}",
  "result": "fail",
  "hook": "on-fail",
  "action": "{share | receive}",
  "timestamp": "{current-timestamp}",
  "custom": {
    "your-custom-data": "{your-custom-data}"
  }
}
```

## Routing parameters

echoshare provides routing parameters for users to customize their experience.

### Automatic full-screen media reception function üòç

This feature is mainly used to share media as a full-screen video and audio media stream, which can be used as a media source for virtual cameras. In particular, the media can be directly viewed and used by switching the route of receiving media from `receive` to `view`, thus meeting the needs of diverse application scenarios.

For example, `https://echoshare.site/~receive?uid=your-uid` can be replaced with: `https://echoshare.site/~view?uid=your-uid` to realize the automatic full screen media receiving function.

### Autoplay

If you want autoplay on incoming media, you can add the `autoplay` parameter to the route for incoming media.

For example, `https://echoshare.site/~receive?uid=your-uid` can be replaced with: `https://echoshare.site/~receive?uid=your-uid&autoplay=true` to realize the autoplay function.
